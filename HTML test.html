<h1>Research is fun</h1>

<p>Antimicrobial resistance has been estimated to be responsible for over 700,000
    deaths per year; therefore, new antimicrobial therapies are urgently needed.
    One way to increase the efficiency of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibiotic">antibiotics</a> is to use them in combination
    with bacteria-specific parasitic viruses, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage">phages</a>, which have been shown to exert
    additive or synergistic effects in controlling bacteria.</p>
<p>However, it is still unclear
    to what extent these combinatory effects are limited by rapid evolution of resistance,
    especially when the pathogen grows as biofilm on surfaces typical for many persistent
    and chronic infections. To study this, we used a microcosm system, where genetically
    isogenic populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 bacterial pathogen were exposed
    to a phage 14/1, gentamycin or a combination of them both in a spatially structured
    environment.</p>
<p>The evolutionary responses to phage–antibiotic combinations could be explained mechanistically
by population density effects, collateral sensitivity or by high costs of adaptation. First, if
phage– antibiotic combination is able to reduce pathogen densities more clearly compared to
single-therapy treatments, it might limit the emergence of resistance mutations to either
therapeutic agent via lowered mutation supply rate. Moreover, antibiotics and phages could be
applied sequentially, which could limit the emergence of double-resistant mutants if both
antimicrobial agents are able to eliminate pathogen genotypes that are resistant to the other
    antimirobial, that is, if phages can kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria and vice versa.</p>
Four evolutionary treatments were established with five replicate microcosms per treatment.
Treatments included P. aeruginosa evolving alone (control), in the presence of gentamycin
antibiotic, in the presence of phage 14/1 or evolving in the presence of both phage and
antibiotic (combination treatment) (Supporting information Figure S1).<br> We used 30 ml glass
universals as microcosms that contained 6 ml of LB and 25 submerged glass beads (VWR).
Previous research has shown that biofilms can form on the outside of plastic beads and
can be successfully isolated using bath sonication (Traverse, Mayo-Smith, Poltak, & Cooper, 2013).<br>
